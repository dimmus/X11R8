## X11

Once upon a midnight hour, long ago, in a galaxy, far, far, away, Xlib
was originally developed by Jim Gettys, of Digital Equipment
Corporation (now part of HP).

Warren Turkal did the autotooling in October, 2003.

Josh Triplett, Jamey Sharp, and the XCB team (xcb@lists.freedesktop.org)
maintain the XCB support.

Individual developers include (in no particular order): Sebastien
Marineau, Holger Veit, Bruno Haible, Keith Packard, Bob Scheifler,
Takashi Fujiwara, Kazunori Nishihara, Hideki Hiura, Hiroyuki Miyamoto,
Katsuhisi Yano, Shigeru Yamada, Stephen Gildea, Li Yuhong, Seiji Kuwari.

The specifications and documentation contain extensive credits.
Conversion of those documents from troff to DocBook/XML was performed
by Matt Dew, with assistance in editing & formatting tool setup from
Gaetan Nadon and Alan Coopersmith.

This work was supported by many organizations (in no particular
order), including the X Consortium, Digital Equipment Corporation,
Tektronix, The Open Group, OMRON, Wyse Technology, Fujitsu Limited,
Sun Microsystems, Fuji Xerox, Sony Corporation, Toshiba Corporation,
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Silicon Graphics, the XFree86
Project, among others.  Patches/fixes came from all over.

## Xproto

The architect of the X11 core protocol was Bob Scheifler of MIT LCS, with
significant contributions from Jim Gettys, Phil Karlton and Scott
McGregor of Digital, Dave Rosenthal of Sun, and many others of
the xpert mailing list.

The original sample server implementation of the X11 protocol was
implemented by Phil Karlton and Susan Angebrandt doing the device
independent part of the server, with Raymond Drewry and Todd Newman of
Digital Equipment Corporation, doing the mi and original ddx
implementation; their feedback was vital to a good design, along with
that of the more than 100 alpha and beta testers who bravely tested
the X11 core design.

The X11 protocol library (Xlib) was built principally by Jim Gettys of
Digital and MIT Project Athena, with assistance from Ron Newman of MIT
Project Athena.

Our thanks to those at MIT, Digital Equipment Corporation, Hewlett-Packard,
IBM, and many others who had faith in us reimplementing X from first
principles.

If there are mistakes here, they are mine; entirely possible after
over 15 years. - Jim Gettys

The above is a description of the core protocol, inherited from the merge of
the various per-protocol repos into this unified project. The LG3D protocol was
by Deron Johnson at Sun Microsystems. XFIXES, DAMAGE and COMPOSITE were by
Keith Packard at HP; DAMAGE had additional contributions from Eric Anholt at
Intel. The remaining extensions had no AUTHORS file; contributions for correct
attribution here would be most welcome. - Adam Jackson
