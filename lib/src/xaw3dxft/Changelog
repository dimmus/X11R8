About libXaw3dxft-1.6.2
-----------------------

This is a newer version which should be entirely source compatible with the
current development versions of libXaw3d-1.6.2 and provides additionally
support for freetype and UTF8 encoding (as did earlier versions
of libxaw3dxft <= 1.3.3). See README in source tree for further details.

2020 Jul 2, libXaw3dxft-1.6.2h

	* TextAction.c: further small enhancements to the edition routines,
	  in such a way that  _Xaw3dXft->edit_delete_alternative = 2
	  corresponds to the default behavior of modern text widgets.

2020 Jun 30, libXaw3dxft-1.6.2g

	* Text.c: the new parameter _Xaw3dXft->text_sb_right (set to 1)
	  allows text widget scrollbars to be put on the right edge
	  of windows.

2020 Jun 16, libXaw3dxft-1.6.2f

	* TextAction.c: two functions added, namely
	    DeleteBackwardCharOnly(), KillCurrentSelectionOrBackwardChar()
	  while DeleteBackwardChar() was modified, and corresponding
	  bindings
	    delete-previous-char-only,  kill-selection-or-char
	  introduced for app-defaults callbacks, so as to accommodate
	  modern editing behavior: BackSpace and Delete keys can now
	  optionally kill the text selection if it is non empty, and
	  otherwise they kill the character backward.
	  This behavior is not enabled by default, but becomes active
	  by setting  _Xaw3dXft->edit_delete_alternative = 1;

2016 Dec 10, libXaw3dxft-1.6.2e

	* 3 line addition in Command.c that circumvents what seems to be
	  a bug of certain X11/Xorg drivers, e.g. the intel driver,
	  version 2.99.917. No other significant change.
	  
2015 Jan 02, libXaw3dxft-1.6.2d

	* Minor API change, functionality identical. The main goal of the
	  change is to make libXaw3dxft source and binary compatible with
	  the newer libXaw3d-1.6.2 library.

2014 Mar 03, libXaw3dxft-1.6.2c

	* A fix has been included, that allows to correctly highlight text
          strings in AsciiText widgets, and also allows making Lists
	  with special colors for directories.
