This directory contains the original library files from the Xaw widget
library.  This directory was created when XawM was installed.

Place this directory ahead of /usr/X11R6/lib in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH
when executing applications which were linked against the original Xaw
library and which depend on it in some way.

You usually only need to do this when your application uses widgets
which are subclassed from Xaw widgets.
