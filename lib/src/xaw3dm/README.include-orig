This directory contains the original include files from the Xaw library.
This directory was created when XawM was installed.

Place this directory ahead of /usr/X11R6/include when building applications
which you wish to link to the original Xaw library instead of XawM.

You only need to do this when your application uses widgets which are
subclassed from Xaw widgets.
