Auto_box - display a rotating cube using PHIGS

It is a simple program that displays four views of a rotating cube.  It
initially displays the cube with filled polygons, then with hollow
polygons, or polylines.  Four views of the cube are presented in four
quadrants. each with a different rotation applied.  In the first and fourth
quadrants the back faces and front faces are respectively culled out,
demonstrating one of the PHIGS PLUS features.  auto_box uses only PHIGS
indexed colors.  Type auto_box to run the program.  It exits after all views
and rotations are completed once.
